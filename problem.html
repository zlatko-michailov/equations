                <p>This method is known as <i>Gaussian Elimination</i>. It is named after its inventor <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss">Carl Friedrich Gauss</a>.</p>

                <p>The method consists of two distinct phases - <i>Elimination</i> and <i>Substitution</i> performed in this order.</p>

                <p class="section-subtitle">Elimination</p>
                <p>
                    During the Elimination phase unknown variables get eliminated one by one which also obsoletes one equation at a time.
                    Thus the number of unknown variables and the number of equations remain equal.
                    The process of elimination relies on the following facts:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Multiplying the two sides of an equation doesn't change the equation.</li>
                    <li>Adding or subtracting two equations yields a valid equation.</li>
                    <li>The order of equations in a system doesn't matter.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>Each elimination iteration consists of the following steps:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Pick a "base" equation that will be used to add or subtract from the other equations.</li>
                    <li>
                        For each of the other equations, pick two factors - one for the current equation and another one for the base equation -
                        so that the coefficient in front of the variable that is being eliminated has the same absolute value in both multiplied equations.
                    </li>
                    <li>Add or subtract the two equations so that the subject variable doesn't appear in the resulting equation.</li>
                    <li>Record the resulting equation as part of a new system.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Thus, after each iteration there is a new system that has one less equation and one less unknown variable than the system from the previous iteration.
                    The phase is complete when there is one equation with one variable left.
                </p>

                <p>That equation is trivial to solve. Once the value of a variable has been found, the substitution phase begins.</p>

                <p class="section-subtitle">Substitution</p>
                <p>
                    The substitution phase consumes the intermediate results from the elimination phase in reverse order -
                    the next to last iteration produced a system of two equations with two unknown variables.
                    One of those variables is already known.
                    Substituting that variable with its value in either of those two equations yields another simple equation with just one unknown variable
                    which is also trivial to solve. Thus the value of the second unknown variable is found.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In general, intermediate elimination results are backtracked with all known variables substituted with their values in any one of the equations.
                    That leads to a simple equation with just one unknown variable which is easy to solve, i.e. the value of one more unknown variable gets determined.
                    The substitution phase ends when the values of all unknown variables have been determined.
                </p>

                <p class="section-subtitle">Remarks</p>
                <p>
                    While the order of eliminating variables doesn't matter, this implementation eliminates variables in "reverse" order.
                    That way substitution determines variable values in prime order, i.e. first x, then y, then z, etc.
